        <h2>Project Objectives</h2>
        <hr>
        <br>
            <h5>As a group we wanted to build and train a model that would use existing judicial rulings of the Supreme Court and potentially predict future rulings as well as understand how the current Court would have ruled on historic cases.</h5>
        <br>
            <h5>Our data source is via <a href="http://scdb.wustl.edu/data.php">Washington University Law</a> (Cases Organized by Supreme Court Citation).</h5>
            <h5>We focused our model training and predictions to Term, Precedent Alteration, Issue Area, Law Type, Case State Origin for justices Kennedy, Scalia, Thomas, Ginsburg, Beryer, Roberts, Alito, Sotomayor, Kagan, and Gorsuch (1991 -2017).</h5>
            <br>
            <h5>Tools utilized:</h5>
                <br> <h6>Data Cleanup and Organization: Python & Jupyter Notebook
                <br> Model Construction: Sci-Kit Learn & Jupyter Notebook
                <br> Model Used: Linear SVM
                <br> Visualizations: Tableau</h6>
        <br>    
        <h2>Project Challenges</h2>
        <hr>
        <br>
            <h4>Objection(s)!</h4>
            <h5>The greatest difficulty we faced was our rudimental knowledge of complex legalese. Some legal concepts proved challenging to interpret and contextualize.</h5>
            <br>
            <h4>Reimagined Expectations</h4>
            <h5>Our initial objective was to predict cases where the Court has yet to hear oral arguments. Given that the most recent term has just ended, and the next term's case agenda is currently in process of being determined, we decided to focus our predictions on a selection of cases from the most recent term (2018), as well as some historic landmark cases - looking to see how the 2017 Court would have ruled on cases that have fundamentally shaped our lives.</h5>
            <br>
            <h4>Trial and Error</h4>
            <h5>Finding a model that fit all justices proved challenging. We tried several (including Linear SVM, Random Forest, Voting Classifier Hard, Voting Classifier Soft, Logistic Regression, and Naive Bayes). In the end, we chose a model that best fit for all justices - Linear SVM.</h5>
            <br>
            <h4>Recuse me?</h4>
            <h5>The human factor was pervasive  in our dataset. Few things about the Supreme Court could be classified as black and white, or binary. Issue area, for one, is subjective. A case argued in front of the Court could have many parts in many issue areas. It's as broad as it is limiting.</h5>
