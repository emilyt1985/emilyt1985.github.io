# Web Visualization Dashboard (Latitude vs Weather)

## Data Collection

This project collected randomized latitude and longitude data from citypy to generate a series of API calls to openweathermap.org. Running the code generates new data and plots 4 visualizations using MatPlotLib to compare wind speed, max temperature, cloudiesness and humidity at varying latitudes. The goal is to view trends in weather based on proximity to or distance from the equator. 

## Running the code

Download and create an 'api_keys.py' file in the 'weather_pull' folder with your openweather.org API key and install all dependicies.

## Dashboard

The frontend dashboard shows the comparison graphs with analysis and was created using Bootstrap.
